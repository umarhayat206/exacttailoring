		Sir, For over 20years I had shirts made by Seymours of Bradford before they disappeared off the map(No idea what happened to them!) When I found your firm I tinkered about trying different materials with varied success until I returned to my fist love..Egyptian Cotton for my most recent order.<br/>
		The 3 shirts came on Friday and WOW they are fantastic!!! They cost more of course, but they're worth every penny.
	<br/>
		Thankyou very much.

	<p>Once again, I am thrilled with the superb after-sales service of your firm.<br/>
	Replacing a shirt which  was not your real responsibility shows customer care of the highest order.<br/>
	Thank you again. I think my latest set of measurements are just about correct now so I shall be in touch when more shirts are required.
	<br/>Best wishes</p>

		Over the past year I have had several shirts commissioned from you. 
		The recent batches have proved to be just as good as the very 
		first. The stitching, fit and workmanship has been of the highest 
		quality. I don’t make this statement lightly as I have travelled 
		extensively across the world and had shirts made in:- New Zealand, 
		Australia, America, Singapore, India and even here on the highly 
		acclaimed Saville Row and Jermyn Street of London’s fashionable and 
		bespoke tailoring centre. I can only say that your shirt certainly 
		rivals the very finest shirt-makers, when one considers the price. 
		The other aspect is the despatch and delivery of the finished 
		articles and this can not be faulted. Please extend my compliments 
		to all in your employ and fabrication of my shirts. In an era when 
		I am otherwise constructing letters of complaint, it is refreshing 
		and lifting when one writes in praise of such excellent standards.
	</p>
	<p>
		To anyone contemplating making or even considering your accolades 
		in shirt making, I would say buy with utter confidence and it will 
		be a decision that might just change the way you purchase a shirt 
		or view them.

		I just wanted to say thank you, having received my five shirts 
		yesterday exactly as specified and a perfect fit. When you read 
		what is offered as a customer you have doubts as these days a lot 
		is oft promised and the delivery leaves a lot to be desired in 
		addition a Post Office Box number does not give you a confident 
		feel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Well on the occasions I phone I was greeted with a human voice, 
		my order was promptly acknowledged, amendments to the order made 
		with ease. The whole service you offer is exactly what you state, 
		your attention to detail is to be admired and if there was an 
		award for delivering what you state you would easily win First 
		Prize.
	</p>
	<p>
		In your company I have no idea who is who but I dealt with Mo 
		Foreman whom is an ambassador for what you stand for. I am really 
		delighted with your product and service and will be recommending 
		you to my colleagues as well as placing another order with. 
		Please keep up your high standards which should be held up as a 
		beacon to others, many thanks indeed.

		If YOU value a quality product and excellent customer service (as I do), then you should consider Exact Personal Tailoring.

	<p>
		I found Mo to be most helpful &amp; efficient - she even spotted a measurement which I had clearly got horribly wrong, and brought it to my attention! The shirts are lovely.
	</p>
	<p>Well done - I will certainly be back</p>
